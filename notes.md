# Joker NLP Analysis

What a nice story of acceptance, would you agree?. Besides It covers a lot of themes. Arthur was carrying his chaos in his head and when he did't have to pretend this chaos went outward. What a beautiful idea!!!

Of course every person might have taken something else from this movie. I think it deserves exploration. Which brings me to this purpose of this post.
As a movie fan I want to make an EDA to find some cool inshights. what makes it so great!!!

oh and also practice regex(lol).

## thinking about extracting data
the data has stucture so some sort of rule based approach would work the best
the next question would be what would be something i could based my rules
and in this case it would be scene headers. i.e. 'INT.- 'and etc.


--------------

notes:
- a simple web app for EDA would be fun
- show problem solving sklls
- useful VIZ
- may be image analysis in the future
- topic modeling for getting themes of the movie
- time series on script :
    - x axis is a page number
    - y axis:
        - sentiment
        - arthur to joker
        - scene importance
        - 
- action per dialog ratio



rules based approach to take outtake the elements(char,int/ext,tod, shots)
disadvantages is that its slow. first rules have to be created
not perfect since every screenplay wruiter writes in uniquely

taking into account this we definately gonna have to do some clean up
that goes to show that every nlp problems will present it s own challenges

optimizations

how to load and store the data in class
call stats like info() in pandas

breaking files into smaller py files

He\\'s wearing an old, faded green cardigan sweater, a threadbare gray scarf, thin from years of use, hangs loosely around his neck. He\\'s sitting across from an overworked SOCIAL WORKER (50\\'s), African American. Her office is cramped and run-down in a cramped and run-down building. Stacks of folders piled high She just sits behind her desk, waiting for his laughing fit to end, she\\'s been through this before. Finally it subsides. Arthur takes a deep breath, pauses to see if it\\'s over. Despite the laughter, there\\'s real pain in his eyes. Something broken in him. Looks like he hasn\\'t slept in days. He reluctantly reaches into the pocket of his jacket hanging on the chair behind him. Pulls out a weathered notebook. She\\'s half-listening as she flips through his journal. She doesn\\'t respond, keeps flipping through his journal-- PAGES AND PAGES OF NOTES, neat, angry-looking handwriting. Also, cut out photos from hardcore pornographic magazines and A flash of anger crosses Arthur\\'s face-- The social worker gives him a look, then reads something in She looks up at Arthur. He just stares back. Lets it hang out Then he laughs a little, even though he doesn\\'t think it\\'s She slides his journal back to him. He holds it in his lap.
